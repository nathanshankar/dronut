[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgz.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked
  CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "gz", but CMake did
  not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gz" with any of
  the following names:

    gzConfig.cmake
    gz-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gz" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "gz_DIR" to
  a directory containing one of the above files.  If "gz" provides a separate
  development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.

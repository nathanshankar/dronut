[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgz_sim.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "gz_sim", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gz_sim" with any
  of the following names:

    gz_simConfig.cmake
    gz_sim-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gz_sim" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "gz_sim_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "gz_sim"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
